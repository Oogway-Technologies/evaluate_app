Especially at this price point. I've always owned Vizios. And I keep coming back to them. Because they are easy to set up, easy to operate and last for a long long time. Mine have gone through move after move and still keep on going strong. The apps are easy to understand. Especially if you are new to smart TV. The color is good. The sound is good. I honestly can't think of any cons.

There are so many channels, and the stations are right on the main menu, so it is effortless to find your favorite show. It doesn't buffer, and the program comes on immediately. The picture is clear, bright, and you can adjust to your liking, and the sound is good for only the tv speakers. The stand was very easy to screw on with included screws.

It was very easy to set up right out of the box. The two legs screw into the bottom with two screws that are in the package for the remote. The remote comes with two batteries so you can use it immediately. The on-screen set up was quick and easy to follow. The TV connected to our internet as soon as we entered the password. The TV is very light so you can move it or hold it on the wall with no problem. The picture is exactly what you have come to expect from these flat screen tv's..it's great. The colors are sharp. The frame around the outside is thin and does not distract from your viewing. There are two speakers with volume that goes up to 100. We are currently using this with no sound system and are happy with the factory sound. There is an interactive tour and set up guide that you can access online that is easy to refer to and helps you learn about the many settings you have to choose from. This TV has 100's of free channels that you can access immediately. You can cast from any smart phone or tablet. The remote has buttons on it so you can quickly access various streaming services. The 40 inch size is perfect in a bedroom, sunroom or spare room. The whole family loves this TV. I highly recommend this TV for anyone in the market for something new!", "submissionTime": "2021-05-08T17:00:00", "title": "GREAT Vizio TV!", "upVotes": "17", "downVotes": "0"}, {"name": "VIZIO 40\" Class D-Series FHD LED Smart TV D40f-J09 (Newest Model)", "overallRating": {"label": "Overall", "rating": "5"}, "reviewer": "RandomShopper", "reviewText": "First off, I really like this tv. It is a good size and has a clear picture. Sound quality is also good. \r\nMaybe it is just me but I could not find the usb/hdmi hook ups. They are located on the back of the tv over on the right side. Kind of hidden. You only get one set of component hook ups (the red, yellow, white cords) Then you have the cable/antenna hook up. \r\nIt seems to me that the tv is really slow at moving from one thing to the other when I press buttons. But this is not a big deal. You do not get a user manual and the little pamphlet you get with the tv is not worth a lot. There are two. One is a short set up guide and the other the print is so tiny I have no idea what it is. I did find the owner manual is available online and accessible through the tv. I had to do a lot of click and guess when setting the television up. It is not hard at all to set up. It will ask you immediately to connect it to wifi. \r\nYou also CAN NOT opt out of sharing data. I do not like this. I declined this option and it went to another page and told me the tv won't work if I decline and I went back to the accept sharing of data page. So there is no way to opt out. I guess you could use the tv not connected to the internet. You would still be able to hook up to cable or an antenna and also add your own components. \r\nThere are lots of free channels and apps preloaded on the tv. Most of it was not anything I was interested in but everyone is different. The remote has buttons for Prime Video, Disney+ and a few other things for quick access. The remote also comes with 2 batteries so you are good to go when you get it out of the box.\r\nThe tv has a usb port and 2 hdmi ports. I had some videos on a usb that were mp4 and I just plugged the usb in to the back of the tv in the usb port, click input on remote, and go to usb and was able to watch my videos.\r\nI have only had this television for a short time but over all it seems to be a great investment. I would recommend it to others.", "submissionTime": "2021-05-09T17:00:00", "title": "Excellent TV", "upVotes": "16", "downVotes": "0"}, {"name": "VIZIO 40\" Class D-Series FHD LED Smart TV D40f-J09 (Newest Model)", "overallRating": {"label": "Overall", "rating": "5"}, "reviewer": "Estrella", "reviewText": "This TV has great high-definition quality. It is perfect for any bedroom or a small living room. I really like the way it was so easy to set up. I was able to scan a barcode with my cell phone to log into the different streaming platforms that I use. Also, it had simple instructions and was easy to use. I only had to attach the legs on the bottom and connect the remote. It could be used in a larger living room, but you might want to consider a soundbar just so the audio is louder in a larger room. Other than that it's a really great TV.", "submissionTime": "2021-05-01T17:00:00", "title": "Excellent high definition quality", "upVotes": "13", "downVotes": "0"}, {"name": "VIZIO 40\" Class D-Series FHD LED Smart TV D40f-J09 (Newest Model)", "overallRating": {"label": "Overall", "rating": "5"}, "reviewer": "crazy25000", "reviewText": "Makes a great secondary TV! How I use it: usually stream videos from apps that come with the TV or cast from phone. No complaints so far and for the price, the performance is good. Would recommend this if needed as a secondary. Currently used in the basement and will probably mount for exercising.\r\n\r\nThe only downside I can think of is if there are 2 Vizio TVs in the same room, remote will work on both. It did for us at least.", "submissionTime": "2021-05-13T17:00:00", "title": "Awesome secondary TV!", "upVotes": "7", "downVotes": "0"}, {"name": "VIZIO 40\" Class D-Series FHD LED Smart TV D40f-J09 (Newest Model)", "overallRating": {"label": "Overall", "rating": "5"}, "reviewer": "Lety159", "reviewText": "I do not even know where to start when stating how much we love this 40 in LED Smart TV! First off, the TV is very light and was easy to mount to the wall. We were amazed by how easy it was to use the remote and set it up. We were able to quickly log in to our streaming accounts right away with no hassle. This TV has 1080 FULL HD and Full Array so the picture quality is outstanding and better than our other TV's that are less than 2 years old. The sound quality is also extremely good! My son can hear the TV very clearly without turning the volume up high and never have to yell to turn it down. The best part for my 4 year old who has the TV in his room is the fact that the remote has the streaming app buttons on it so he doesn't have to ask for help when turning them on searching for them on the menu. He turns the TV on and presses Netflix or Disney + or YouTube himself. This TV is very user friendly! This TV also has 2 HDMI inputs and 1 USB input and built-in Chromecast as well Can't go wrong with this TV!!!", "submissionTime": "2021-05-14T17:00:00", "title": "AMAZING SMART TV", "upVotes": "6", "downVotes": "0"}, {"name": "VIZIO 40\" Class D-Series FHD LED Smart TV D40f-J09 (Newest Model)", "overallRating": {"label": "Overall", "rating": "5"}, "reviewer": "Meghank09", "reviewText": "I have never owned a smart TV before. To say I am impressed is an understatement! This TV has it all! The picture quality is outstanding. I really like the fact that it makes you feel like you are in the show or movie you are watching because the quality is out of this world. I thought setup was going to be complicated but it wasn't at all. The instructions are easy to read and the TV itself even helps you figure out how to set up everything you need. It connected to my Wi-Fi so easily it was effortless. It provides instructions to guide you along the way. The size of the screen is great! I love that it is so large.\r\n The fact that I am able to use my Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ accounts is amazing. I was able to link them and enjoy right away. You can also watch YouTube! Even if you don't have subscription accounts, there are so many free movies and videos that come with this TV already. I was absolutely blown away at how many different channels and movies come with it. I never had any idea you were able to enjoy so much content without having to pay extra. My kids were thrilled to see there were a lot of movies that they have not seen and they get to watch them for free! The sound quality is so clear. The best I have ever heard on any TV. We didn't even want to set up surround sound speakers because it works so well in our bedroom. Something that I appreciate and I know it's just a small thing but when you turn the TV on and off it does not make a clicking noise. That's really nice. I don't think I could be any more satisfied than I am. I am thoroughly amazed at Vizio and the quality of this television. Our family movie nights are even more enjoyable.

This Vizio 40 Lass FHD LED Smart TV D-Series was super easy to set up and I love that I no longer need my Roku device to access all the great streaming apps. The picture is crisp and clear and any smudges buff clean with a microfiber cloth. The remote allows you to quickly and easily access Netflix, Peacock, Prim, Disney+, Crackles & Tubi without having to go to the app screen. The only small issue I have with the tv is that the volume doesn't get quite as loud as I would like but I have a soundbar to hook up to rectify that so no biggie.
